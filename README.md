<h1>Instructions</h1>

<ol>
        <li>Wet Ingredients: combine the egg whites with some of the buttermilk in a bowl. In a mixing bowl, with a paddle attachment, beat room temperature butter, sugar, vanilla extract, and almond extract.
        <li>Dry Ingredients: in a separate bowl, combine the dry ingredients.
        <li>Combine: Add the dry ingredients to the butter and sugar mixture. Beat in the egg white mixture and finally, beat in the remaining buttermilk. Fold in coconut.
        <li>Bake: Use two 9-inch cake pans for this recipe. Use a generous amount of baking spray (this is the kind with flour in it, made for baking), or use parchment paper. You could also use homemade cake release.
        <li>Assemble: Place one cake layer on a cake stand. Add a large amount of frosting to top and smooth with an offset spatula. Top with second layer of cake. Apply coconut cream cheese frosting to entire cake.
        <li>Sprinkle coconut flakes on top and sides of the cake. Place the cake stand on a baking sheet. This will catch any extra coconut.
        <li>Fill hand with coconut and press gently into sides of cake. Repeat until desired amount of coconut applied.
